      <guid>https://blog.test:8443/2018/11/spring-boot-trailing-whitespaces/</guid>
      <description>__TL;DR:__Spring Boot does not trim off the trailing whitespaces in *.properties that in turn might lead to some unexpected errors. As the Spring development team decides to not fix this issue, we can configure code editors to avoid some similar problems.</description>

      <description>QuickLook is a simple but powerful feature of macOS that helps to preview the content of a file or folder in Finder without using any particular apps. This feature is very handy when we only want to have brief glance on a certain file or quickly examine its parts instead of opening a full-fledged app for that particular file.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a blazingly fast static site generator based on Go. My first experience with Hugo was truly pleasant. I appreciate the separation of contents, presentations, and site generation logics in Hugo that leads to less effort for maintenance or switching themes.</description>

      <description>Webpack is a static module bundler for Web applications. It analyses and processes the input application and generates output bundles.
The design of Webpack architecture is highly modularised and extendable. In this post, I share here some notes on major aspects of Webpack since I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning it.</description>
