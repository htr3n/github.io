      <description>Introduction Together, Apache HTTP server, PHP, and MySQL form a powerful and popular combination for Web development. Mac OS X (from 10.0 Cheetah to 10.11 El Capitan) and macOS (10.12 Sierra and above) are often shipped with pre-installed versions of Apache HTTP server and PHP but these are often outdated and merely customised for macOS.
