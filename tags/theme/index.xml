      <description>Gentelella is a very nice and gently-looking Bootstrap based admin theme developed by Aigars Silkalns (known as puikinsh in Github), who founded colorlib.com. It can be integrated into several Web application frameworks. In this post, I noted down my simple development exercise in which Gentelella is used to decorated a Laravel 5 based Web application. This task is part of building my PHP based framework LaraMod.
Laravel can act as backend for any Web application.</description>
