      <description>Gentelella is a very nice and gently-looking Bootstrap based admin theme developed by Aigars Silkalns (known as puikinsh in Github), who founded colorlib.com. It can be integrated into several Web application frameworks. In this post, I noted down my simple development exercise in which Gentelella is used to decorated a Laravel 5 based Web application. This task is part of building my PHP based framework LaraMod.
Laravel can act as backend for any Web application.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://laravel.com&#34;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing emerging, well-designed and well-developed PHP framework. It is currently under active development and has been among top Web development frameworks. The latest version of Laravel 5 imposes a conventional project structure that is well documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/structure&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For a simple development project, the structure is totally fine. Nevertheless, unless some necesssary configurations you might not want to mix up your development codes and resources with Laravel&amp;rsquo;s. And you might also want to organise your project into submodules that are assigned to more than one team/person such that they can be developed silmutaneously. Thus, the need for complex submodule organisation is quite obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
