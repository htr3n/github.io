      <description>Web Service Development with Apache CXF I have used Apache CXF 2.2 to develop Web services for some R&amp;amp;D projects that I took part in. At that time, I considered either Apache Axis/Axis2 or CXF (formerly Codehaus XFire project). I eventually decided to get along with CXF due to its simplicity, quite clear documentation, good support for document-style Web services (+) and many standards, especially JAX-WS and JAX-RS that I really loved.</description>
