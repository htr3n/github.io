      <description>To commence my journey in software development, I have looked for a Web framework to build this blog. I have started writing blog posts mainly using (Multi)Markdown and plan to migrate other posts to Markdown too. Thus, it&amp;rsquo;s rather natural to go with built-in or first-class support for Markdown to minimise the migration effort.
Thus far I have not foreseen any great use of extensive backend storage and computation. So I narrowed down my search to static site generators with two prominent candidates Jekyll and Hugo popping up, for instance, here, here, and here.</description>
