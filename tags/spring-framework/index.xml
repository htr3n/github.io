      <description>Recently I had to upgrade a codebase using Hibernate 3.x ORM on Spring 3 to Hibernate 5 (and Spring 5, respectively). Here I note down some aspects and issues that I have to deal with during this migration.</description>

      <description>I started using Spring framework few years back in 2009 to develop demo systems for some EU projects. These projects featured a number of Web services some of which share back-end databases and some other talk to external services or WS-BPEL business processes.</description>

      <title>Spring Boot properties issues with trailing whitespaces</title>
      <link>https://blog.test:8443/2018/11/spring-boot-trailing-whitespaces/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.test:8443/2018/11/spring-boot-trailing-whitespaces/</guid>
      <description>__TL;DR:__Spring Boot does not trim off the trailing whitespaces in *.properties that in turn might lead to some unexpected errors. As the Spring development team decides to not fix this issue, we can configure code editors to avoid some similar problems.</description>

      <description>Spring is a popular heavy-weight framework for developing Java/Groovy based applications. Its rich libraries and software stack can cover from front-end to back-end development.

      <description>I have used Apache CXF 2.2 to develop Web services for some R&amp;amp;D projects that I took part in. At that time, it was a choice between Apache Axis/Axis2 and CXF (formerly Codehaus XFire project).</description>
