      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella&#34;&gt;Gentelella&lt;/a&gt; is a very nice and gently-looking &lt;a href=&#34;https://getbootstrap.com&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; based admin theme developed by Aigars Silkalns (known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/puikinsh&#34;&gt;puikinsh&lt;/a&gt; in Github), who founded &lt;a href=&#34;https://colorlib.com&#34;&gt;colorlib.com&lt;/a&gt;. It can be integrated into several Web application frameworks. In this post, I noted down my simple development exercise in which Gentelella is used to decorated a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laravel/laravel&#34;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; 5 based Web application. This task is part of building my PHP based framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/htr3n/laramod&#34;&gt;LaraMod&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Laravel is an amazing emerging, well-designed and well-developed PHP framework. It is currently under active development and has been among top Web development frameworks. The latest version of Laravel 5 imposes a conventional project structure that is well documented here. For a simple development project, the structure is totally fine. Nevertheless, unless some necesssary configurations you might not want to mix up your development codes and resources with Laravel&amp;rsquo;s. And you might also want to organise your project into submodules that are assigned to more than one team/person such that they can be developed silmutaneously.</description>

      <title>Apache httpd 2.4 and PHP 7 in macOS</title>

      <description>Together, Apache HTTP server, PHP, and MySQL form a powerful and popular combination for Web development. Mac OS X (from 10.0 Cheetah to 10.11 El Capitan) and macOS (10.12 Sierra and above) are often shipped with pre-installed versions of Apache HTTP server and PHP but these are often outdated and merely customised for macOS. The well-known bundles *AMP (e.g. WAMP for Windows, LAMP for Linux, MAMP for Mac) are commonly used but also considered a tad bloated for the beginners like me ;).</description>
