      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have experienced a number of different Mac systems, ranging from the old white MacBook 2006 to the MacMini 2010 and MacBook Pro 13&amp;rdquo; and 15&amp;rdquo; lately. Time Machine has helped me a lot to transfer data from the old to the new machine. Nevertheless, a lot of changes, mostly for software development, have often been ignored or reset to the defaults due to many reasons (e.g. against security advice, etc.).  And I often find myself searching around everytime for some desirable settings. Thus, this post is kind of a note to self on few useful tweaks for my development box so that I can easily reach out later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Together, Apache HTTP server, PHP, and MySQL form a powerful and popular combination for Web development. Mac OS X (from 10.0 Cheetah to 10.11 El Capitan) and macOS (10.12 Sierra and above) are often shipped with pre-installed versions of Apache HTTP server and PHP but these are often outdated and merely customised for macOS. The well-known bundles *AMP (e.g. WAMP for Windows, LAMP for Linux, MAMP for Mac) are commonly used but also considered a tad bloate or overkill for the beginners like me ;).</description>
