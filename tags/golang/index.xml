      <description>Yesterday I got notified from Github for two opening issues of the Hugo&amp;rsquo;s theme hyde-hyde I have ported and developed.
The newest one is reported by jdayton3 (Jonathan Dayton) on wrong dates shown up. The issue seems very strange and difficult to spot. It took me a while to research around and found some relevant reports by Paul Heinlein and Dana Woodman, that Hugo date/time formatting is internally based on Golang, and therefore, uses a smart but confusing convention.</description>

      <title>First Experience with Hugo</title>

      <description>To commence my journey in software development, I have looked for a Web framework to build this blog. I have started writing blog posts mainly using (Multi)Markdown and plan to migrate other posts to Markdown too. Thus, it&amp;rsquo;s rather natural to go with built-in or first-class support for Markdown to minimise the migration effort.
Thus far I have not foreseen any great use of extensive backend storage and computation. So I narrowed down my search to static site generators with two prominent candidates Jekyll and Hugo popping up, for instance, here, here, and here.</description>
