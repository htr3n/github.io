      <description>Laravel is an amazing emerging, well-designed and well-developed PHP framework. It is currently under active development and has been among top Web development frameworks. The latest version of Laravel, 5.5.x, imposes a conventional project structure that is well documented here. For a simple development project, the structure is totally fine. Nevertheless, unless some necesssary configurations you might not want to mix up your development codes and resources with Laravel&amp;rsquo;s. And you might also want to organise your project into submodules that are assigned to more than one team/person such that they can be developed silmutaneously.</description>
