        <h1>About</h1>
        

<p><em>htr3n</em> (aka <em>Huy Tran</em>) is a software researcher and developer. He earned his bachelor degree in 2002 and was a lecturer at <a href="http://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/site/en">HCM City University of Technology</a>, Vietnam until October 2005. He got a scholarship from Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research and earned his Ph.D. in December 2009. Huy started working as software researcher at <a href="https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en">Vienna University of Technology</a> (2009-2011) and <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/en">University of Vienna</a> (2011-2017) in Austria.</p>

<p>Since starting his research in 2005, he had taken part in several European and national R&amp;D projects such as WWTF CONTAINER, EU FP7 INDENICA, EU FP7 COMPAS, and SemBiz. His research interests are including software architecture, distributed systems, SOAs, event-driven architectures, model-driven engineering, and application of formal methods.</p>

<p>Huy has extensively involved in software development in Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, Go, and shell scripting. Many of his research outcomes have been transferred into software development techniques. He developed a view-based modelling framework (VbMF) using Eclipse/EMF/Xtext/Xtend that can be used to design process-driven SOAs and automatically generate code and configurations in BPMN/BPEL/WSDL/XML/Java. VbMF was used in collaboration with some European industrial partners for modelling and generating a large-scale loan approval process-centric system.</p>

<p>Another view-based modelling techniques have been developed for designing and generating code and configurations for virtual service platforms running on top of Service-Component Architectures and relevant remote communication technologies such as JMS and SOAP/REST/HTTP. This modelling tool suite has been used to design and implement a large-scale platform integration solution that incorporating parts of cloud-based Ruby-on-Rails Yard Management Systems, .NET/C++ Warehousing Management Systems, and Java based Realtime Monitoring Systems from European industrial partners.</p>
